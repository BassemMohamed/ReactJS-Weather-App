# ReactJS-Weather-App
This simple ReactJS Weather App uses openweathermap.org API to get weather information for Munich (City in Germany) then It displays the data in a barChart and computes the average temp and humidaty.

PS: It is live at https://reactjs-weather-app.netlify.com/ using Netlify.

This project could be improved in a multiple of ways : 

1. Better responsive design.
2. Unit tests.
3. City selector at the start to specify cities other than Munich.
4. Date range selector at the start.
5. Show more information like a humidaty graph.
6. Have more visuals ( Rain icons on rainy days or sun icons on sunny days ).
